File name	Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ESM_1.txt	Short description of electronic supplementary material.

ESM_2.csv 	Waggle dance data collected from multiple studies, only
		giving one mean for a given distance.

		Column names:
		study		Author/year for the study
		distance	Feeder distance
		duration	Waggle run duration
		covariates	Additional information available for the 
				calibration data point
		full reference	Full reference to the study

ESM_3.jag 	Model specification for the Bayesian distance to waggle run
		duration calibration used by JAGS 3.3.0. Called from R
		script ESM_4.R.

ESM_4.R 	R script to simulate dances from known waggle dance durations
		and headings. The simulated dances are output as a
		*.csv file with the easting and northings as
		coordinates. The dances are also rasterized,
		calculating the probability that a given raster was
		visited by a dance, and plotted. We demonstrate how to
		plot such heat maps on top of aerial photography, but
		do not provide such aerial photography because we
		purchased it comercially.

ESM_5.csv Waggle dances used in our calibration experiment.

		Column names:
		(empty)		data row number
		dance.id	ID of the dance
		year		year of data collection
		month		month of data collection
		day		day of data collection
		hour		hour of data collection
		minute		minute of data collection
		duration	mean duration of waggle runs for that dance
		distance	feeder distance
		bee.id		ID of the dancing bee
		heading		mean heading indicated by the dancing bee to the 
				feeder location
